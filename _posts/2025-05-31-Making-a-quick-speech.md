I will start of with the main body since many people find the main body quite hard .So for the MAIN BODY we can use the technique called P.C.E.S. :

P-Problem

C-Causes

E-Effect

S-Solution

I will delve into each of these meanings but first you need a title relating to your topic ,something interesting to the audience and something that curiosity can get the better of them.

Problem-It is the topic that you are talking about ,just investigate and explain to the audience what your topic really is  so they can understand a little bit more in case some people don't know about it.

Causes-What led to it happening , like who did it .Explain about why it happened

Effect-Now this is where you explain how it can effect us or the society around us all ,everything around us how does it change the environment around us .

Solution-Finally now you explain how we can reduce the ongoing problem and talk and research about way that we can use to help solve the problem .

Lastly, in the main body include the phrases :According to researchers, Based on the results of scientists and some more if you can think of.

IMPORTANT!!

Never forget to add some facts that might be interesting and my top advice for these fact would use percentages numbers and fractions.

Now , for the closing ,end with a quote and a rhyming quote  related to your speech .

Now ,for your opening make up a story indicating to your problem  and maybe start of with a question and give one fact to start of with

So, now you know how to make a speech in the span of 2-5 minutes if you need it .
