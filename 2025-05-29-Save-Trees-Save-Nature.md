Have you ever heard of these men wiling to sell and buy their own life in the greed for money and luxury.
On earth  over a widespan of time mankind have relied on trees and plant for survival e.g. food, travel ,materials, furniture , construction ,
medicines ,paper ant more.

"Nature is an infente sphere of which the centre is everywhere and circumference is nowhere"-Blaise Pascal

Now trees as we know can take in carbon dioxide and give oxygen ,but do you know how much ? Just one trees can absorbs billion of tonnes
of carbon dioxide .Then only 1 human breathes up to 22,000 to 25,000 times a day. How much carbon dioxide will their be in the air? With 8 
billion or even more people in the world . Mankind has cut down trees to be used for comfort like for example weapons , medicines, all the
effect it gives to all  living things on daily basis is less oxygen ,pollution , increase in climate change and global warming , habitat
loss and animals left with no shelter and safety.Sadly there is 42 million trees being cut down everyday .
Luckily we can solve this unbearable issue by educating students and others to plant trees and put up workshops and encouraging people to
respect and use less trees .



As a result  we can help the environment by planting more trees and safeguarding the one ones already existing and not increasing the 
number of species which went extinct.Up to now there are at least 600 species extinct only from the year 1750.In a world increasingly 
shaped by concrete and machines, the quiet presence of trees remains one of our most vital connections to nature. They purify the air 
we breathe, conserve water, reduce soil erosion, and offer a sanctuary for countless species. Trees are not just part of the environment—they
are its backbone. Their silent labor supports ecosystems, stabilizes our climate, and nourishes our planet in ways we
often overlook.

Saving trees is more than an act of conservation; it's an act of survival. Each tree lost weakens the chain of life, while every tree saved 
strengthens the future.Whether it's by reducing paper waste, supporting reforestation efforts, or simply planting a sapling, we each have a
role to play. The health of forests reflects the
health of our planet, and by protecting them, we are protecting ourselves and every life form that depends on them.

Let this not be a message for awareness alone, but a call to action. Let us choose sustainability over short-term gain, preservation over destruction,
and harmony
over exploitation. Because when we save trees, we don’t just preserve greenery—we preserve life, legacy, and hope for a better tomorrow.


Thank You
